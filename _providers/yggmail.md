    Make sure, the Yggmail companion app runs whenever you want to use this account.
    Note, that you usually cannot write from @yggmail addresses to normal e-mail-addresses (as @gmx.net). However, you can create another account in the normal e-mail-network for this purpose.

Yggmail servers usually exist only on your local device
and you need to install a companion app to make them work.
