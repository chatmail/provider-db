Unfortunately, Protonmail doesn't offer IMAP, so you cannot log in with Delta Chat to Protonmail.

If you really want to use Delta Chat with Protonmail, you can check out their IMAP bridge at <https://protonmail.com/bridge/>, however, note that the bridge does not work on all operating system and not on all Protonmail accounts.
