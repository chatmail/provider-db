To use your iCloud email address [it is required to generate a specific password for it](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202304). Afterwards you can use your iCloud email address and the newly created password.

When using a Custom Email Domain hosted on iCloud+ you need to: 
- fill in the address you want to use in the "E-Mail Adress" field,
- fill in your iCloud login email in "Advanced > IMAP Login Name" and "Advanced > SMTP Login Name", and
- fill "Advanced > IMAP Server" with "imap.mail.me.com" and "Advanced > SMTP Server" with "smtp.mail.me.com".
